# carbonplayer Framework

Framework for game simulation with minimax and genetic algorithm.

## Features

### minimax

The main algorithm for choosing the next move is [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) 

### Genetic Algorithm

## Limitations in simulated games

### 2 players only

You can simulate chess or tic-tac-toe, and 2 players version of Poker.

You **cannot** simulate "Incan Gold". This is due to the actual minimax algorithm implementation.
